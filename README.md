Problem statement:Ball Frenzy: Implement a simple Catch the Ball game using
Python GUI and Tkinter. Within the game window, there is a bar
located at the bottom that can be horizontally adjusted using the
buttons provided within the window. A red ball will continuously

fall from the top to the bottom and can start from any random x-
axis distance. The task is to position that bar at a suitable

location by moving left or right so that the red ball will fall onto
the bar and not onto the ground. If the player catches the ball
onto the bar, their score will increase and that ball will disappear.
A new red ball will then start falling from the top to the bottom,
beginning from a random x-axis distance. If the player misses
catching the ball onto the bar, they will lose the game and a
popup message will display indicating the player has lost. Finally,
the scorecard will appear on the game window.
